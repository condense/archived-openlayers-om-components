# openlayers-om-components

Openlayers data entry components using Om.

## Features

* Suitable for use in forms requiring user to draw points or boxes on a map
* Presents displays maps with features using openlayers
* Interactively add, move, resize and delete features

## Technology

We use Openlayers 3

We use the CLJSJS Openlayers package as the basis of our integration 

We are using code from an active Openlayers PR for providing interactive transformations.  When this PR 
is accepted the related code will be removed from our codebase.

There might be value in add new components and evolving the ones we have to suit other common use cases.  

## Opportunities to get involved

* Adding new controls, improve existing controls, etc...
* Improving the user interactions (As of the time I write this we lean on shift-click to add features)
* Helping us fill our inspiration scrapbook with good maps and map user interfaces by sending screenshots, 
links and the like.
